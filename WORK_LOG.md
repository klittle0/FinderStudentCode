| Oct 25 | 2:30-3:00pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                            I started thinking about the problem with Liliana. We know we want to use hashing for the keys, and we want the values to remain in their original forms. We also think we want to use a map/hashmap to retrieve the values in constant time. But We are still trying to figure out how to do that without having a super long array. |
| Oct 25 | 5:00-5:30pm  |                                                                                                                    I considered using an array of arraylists. I considered creating an array list of length 6 since the first 6 digits of each barcode represent a company. Then, each company could have an arraylist inside it for all of the company's products. However, I don't know how I would use this system for non-barcode data, and I think the arraylists might get too long & the algorithm wouldn't be more efficient than a basic linear search. |
| Oct 30 | 12:35-1:45pm |                                                                                                                                        After talking with classmates and Mr. Blick, I decided to stay with the array of arraylists idea, but instead use each arraylist to represent the collisions that happen at each index, aka each hash value. The array would have to be the length of my large prime. To keep track of the data further, I will make a data type like a tuple that stores both the key and corresponding value. I wrote my hash function. |
| Oct 31 | 6:30-7:00pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               I wrote my "tuple" class and planned my buildtable & makehash methods with pseudocode. I had a little trouble initializing my array of arraylists of tuples, but I think I finally figured it out. |
| Nov 1  | 5:45-6:45am  |                         I drafted both build table & make hash methods. After making some changes to the way I was using my buffered reader, my code worked for the first 2 test cases. I am getting a key mismatch error for the last 2 tests. I looked into the "DIJA" test, and it seems like the expected vs. actual keys are nowhere near each other in the csv file. I changed my tuple class to store the key instead of the hash of the key, and I changed my query method to compare keys instead of the hashes of the keys, and now I pass every test! |

I have done first drafts of add, get, and resize methods. Next time, I need to revise my finder class to implement the hashmap class. |
| Nov 2  | 8:00-8:45am  | I revised my finder class & fixed a couple errors that appeared in my console. Now, my code is passing for the first few cases, but it is timing out for the last case every time. I adjusted the DEFAULT_TABLE_SIZE to 10,000 to see if that changed things, and increased the timeout limit to 6,000 milliseconds, and it passed the test. It takes around 3 seconds. Whenever I lower the starting table size, it times out. I need to go through my code to figure out why the code is so inefficient right now, despite implementing an optimized strategy. |
| Nov 5  | 9:00-10:00am |                                                    I looked through all of my methods & decided to modify my get method in the hashmap class so it didn't check every index of the map for a value, but rather just the small cluster around the index of the hash value. I then changed the default table size to a prime number to minimize the potential # of collisions. These changes greatly reduced the time it took for the last case, so now it averages a little less than 2 seconds every time. I also went through my code to improve documentation. |
