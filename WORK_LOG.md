| Oct 25 | 2:30-3:00pm  |                                                                                                         I started thinking about the problem with Liliana. We know we want to use hashing for the keys, and we want the values to remain in their original forms. We also think we want to use a map/hashmap to retrieve the values in constant time. But We are still trying to figure out how to do that without having a super long array. |
| Oct 25 | 5:00-5:30pm  | I considered using an array of arraylists. I considered creating an array list of length 6 since the first 6 digits of each barcode represent a company. Then, each company could have an arraylist inside it for all of the company's products. However, I don't know how I would use this system for non-barcode data, and I think the arraylists might get too long & the algorithm wouldn't be more efficient than a basic linear search. |
| Oct 30 | 12:35-1:45pm |                     After talking with classmates and Mr. Blick, I decided to stay with the array of arraylists idea, but instead use each arraylist to represent the collisions that happen at each index, aka each hash value. The array would have to be the length of my large prime. To keep track of the data further, I will make a data type like a tuple that stores both the key and corresponding value. I wrote my hash function. |

I had a little trouble initializing my array of arraylists of tuples, but I think I finally figured it out. |
